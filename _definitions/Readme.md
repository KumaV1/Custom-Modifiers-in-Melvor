This folder contains type definitions for this mod, sich as API endpoints and the modifiers added (though also contains some more stuff.

**Important**: There may be support for properties, modifiers etc. related to monster types in these type definitions.

Though doesn't mean that the same info doesn't exist for other monster types as well.
