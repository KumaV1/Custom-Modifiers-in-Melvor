    Monster_Type_Overview_Remarks_Custom_Mods_Monster_Type_Allocation: "For any monsters added through other mods, said mods have to set type definitions themselves for those monsters. If a mod doesn't have this mod as dependency, it generally means that none of their monsters are affected by this type definition",
